## Demo video:
pass (**TODO**)

## Features:
* 1 new special item (staff)
* New relic item
* 3 *new* weapons / tools (axe, pickaxe, sword)
* Schrodingers Breakfast (new food)
* Every item with a custom texture

    ### Schrodingers Staff:
  _A powerful staff to do some crazy things_
  * Crafted like this:
  
  ![recipe1](pictures/pic%20(1).png)
  * Right click not opened structure chest to change the loot (still loot table corresponding)
  * Right click a trapped chest with one item (count doesn't matter), get the item replaced by some random item
  * Get a relic item, _and maybe damage ..._
  
  ### Relic item:
    _A relic that some crazy things happened_
    * Read **Schrodingers Staff** to know how to obtain
    * Craft one of the 3 new weapons or the new food

  ### *New* weapons:
    _Unknown what they are_
  * Relic Axe, Relic Pickaxe, Relic Sword
  * Crafted like this:
  
  ![recipe2](pictures/pic%20(2).png)
  ![recipe3](pictures/pic%20(3).png)
  ![recipe4](pictures/pic%20(4).png)

  * Using them immediately is a bad idea ... hit an entity to detect what material they are made of
  * For example: You craft a Relic Sword. You hit a zombie. And the sword decides its state. Maybe it's a wooden sword or even made out of diamonds?
  
  ### Schrodingers Breakfast:
    _You like the surprise effect when you eat something?_
  * Crafted like this:
  
  ![recipe5](pictures/pic%20(5).png)
  * Right click to eat
  * You'll get one of 10 random effects (poison, speed, ...)

## How to use:
* Download the .jar on Modrinth [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/schrodingers-chest "Modrinth")
* Use **Minecraft 1.21.1** and **Fabric**
* Or clone the repo and compile it on your own

## The idea behind this:
Maybe you know Schrödinger's Cat. Erwin Schrödinger was a scientist doing research on quantum mechanics, particular the Schrödinger's equation and his thought experiment **Schrödinger's Cat**.
The cat is in a sealed box alive and dead at the same time until observed due to the paradox of applying quantum mechanics on something like a cat.

I took this as inspiration and created **Schrödingers Chest**. The content of the chest is changeable (using the staff on structure chests or trapped chest) and you don't exactly know what you get until you open the chest / observe the inside.
This also applies to the weapons. You don't know what material they are until you directly observe them or in this case hit an entity. And the Schrodingers Breakfast, it also follows the same pattern. You don't know what is inside the bread until you eat it.

I thought this is a funny minecraft mod idea.
